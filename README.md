**Executive Summary**

At Essos, we believe finding Real Estate for rent or sale should be seamless and easy. And we
strive to provide our users the most convenient and easy-to-navigate interface, making their
experience of finding or selling real estate as easy as pie.

Real Estate has been a growing market ever since anyone can remember. But since the beginning
of globalization, the flow of people and capital around the world has led to a massive surge in
prices all over the world. San Francisco is a prime example of one such global hub that has seen
ridiculous increase in the cost of housing. At the same time, there hasn't been a significant
increase in the number of services that people can find online. Among the ones that already exist,
there haven't been enough that are easy to use for the average Joe. This is where Essos comes in.

Essos is a Web-based real estate listing platform that allows users to post and browse through
listings in any town, city, state or zip code within the United States. Unlike other platforms on
the market, Essos is designed to make the browsing experience significantly easier for users so
that anybody – a young working professional, a retired construction worker or a foreign student
new to the country; can make good use of it to their own benefit. Essos is also a great platform
for real estate agents. Users seeking professional help, to maximize their chances of a good deal,
can get in touch with registered Agents and fix up an arrangement. Postings will include photos
and map-integration, making it convenient for interested parties to find further information about
the locality.

With more and more people moving to new places and a shortage of platforms to cope with the
demand, we believe Essos will not only gain a huge traction of users but also triumph against the
competition due to its wide array of features and superior user-interface that anybody can use. If
you believe that you can be a part of Essos's success story, feel free to contact our management
team or drop a message through the "Contact us" section on the website.

Essos was started by a team of six undergraduate developers at San Francisco State University
and is led by Dragutin Petkovic, former Chair of Computer Science at SFSU, as Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Anthony Souza, graduate and now a lecturer at the same, as Chief Technical
Officer (CTO). The team includes students from very diverse backgrounds and unique specialties
in their respective fields. Sharing the common experiences of struggling in the expensive San
Francisco housing market, our team understands how difficult it can be to find good housing in
today’s fast paced world. Thus, with experience and extensive research, our developers have
created Essos which shall be your newest friend to finding and selling real estate.
